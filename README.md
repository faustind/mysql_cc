* Any set up commands that need to be run before the examples and exercises.
* The example SQL statements used in each chapter of the book.
* Answers to the "Try It Yourself" exercises in each chapter of the book.

Copy and paste the commands you are interested in from the script and run them against your own database using your favorite MySQL graphical tool (like MySQL Workbench).
